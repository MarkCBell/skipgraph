Getting started
===============

Compile the cGraphs etension using::

	> sage --python setup.py install --user

The code can also be compiled for python by using::

	> python setup.py install --user

To compare this classes algorithm with sage's builtin graph.diameter() algorithm use::

	> sage --python test.py

Idea
====

The key lemma which powers this method and provides the large speedup is that:

	|ecc(x) - ecc(y)| <= d(x, y).
	
Hence if ecc(v) is large and and we have just found that ecc(x) is small then
we know that any vertex y in B(x, ecc(w) - ecc(x)) must have ecc(y) <= ecc(w).

Thus in searching for a vertex with eccentricty larger than that of w we can
skip everything in this ball. Furthermore, as we compute ecc(x) by performing
a DFT of the graph, the vertices in this ball are essentially already known.
